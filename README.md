## Apply Horvath's clock and calculate age acceleration
## Use Horvath's clock with adjusted-BMIQ normalisation (same as Horvath's paper)
horvath_age <- methyAge(betas, clock=clock_name, age_info=info, fit_method='Linear', do_plot=TRUE)

print(horvath_age)
#                         Sample  Age    Sex     mAge Age_Acceleration

#### To calculate PCGrimAge, 'age_info' should be a dataframe that contains sample ID, age, sex information ####
PC_GrimAge <- methyAge(betas, clock = "PCGrimAge", age_info=info)

```

By default, methyAge would plot the age prediction results and the distribution of age acceleration, to save the plot:
```R
pdf('savename.pdf', width=4.3, height=6)
horvath_age <- methyAge(betas, clock=clock_name, age_info=info, fit_method='Linear', do_plot=TRUE)
dev.off()
```
Here is the result plot(very nice!):

Now you can try other clocks by simply redefine the 'clock_name' and keep other codes unedited. Normally, the clock of Horvath2013 costs the highest amount of time due to its unefficient normalisation steps, for other clocks such as Hannum2013, the overall running time is very short. Please refer to the below code to learn more about how to use the method.
```R
library('dnaMethyAge')

help(methyAge)
```


Lastly, I provide the epiginetic age prediction results in four clocks for [GSE147221](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147221) in below(click on the image to have a more clear look).

## 3. Attention
The original model of Hannum2013 not only uses the 72 CpG sites, but also includes covariates gender, BMI, diabetes status, ethnicity and batch, howevever, the authors did not provide the coefficients for those covariates. In this method, I only used the 72 CpG sites to calculate the Hannum2013 age, and this is the commom practice in this field.

The four clocks' prediciton performance may vary in different datasets, and the Levine2018 also known as PhenoAge was not directly trained on chronological age.
